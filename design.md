ðŸŽ¨ Design Plan
1. Overall Style

    Font: Use Poppins for a modern, friendly look.

    Theme: Dark mode or soft gradient background with vibrant accent colors (e.g. blue, purple, neon green).

    Spacing: Generous padding/margin to avoid clutter.

    Animations: Smooth transitions and hover effects for buttons and links.

2. Header (.hero)

    Design Goal: Eye-catching hero banner.

    Background: Use a large blurred Discord-themed image or gradient (e.g. dark to violet).

    Text:

        h1: Large, bold welcome text (white).

        p: Medium size, lighter color (e.g. #ccc).

    CTA Button:

        Style: Rounded, large, contrasting (e.g. neon green on dark).

        Hover effect: Glow or slight scale-up.

3. About Section (.about)

    Layout: Centered with generous white space.

    Typography:

        h2: Medium-large, bold.

        p: Readable width, soft tone (gray/white).

    Decor: Optional icon or graphic to match text (e.g. handshake, controller).

4. Join Section (.join)

    Highlight: Main conversion area.

    Join Button:

        Bold and vibrant (e.g. Discord blurple or neon color).

        Big enough to stand out, animate on hover.

    Discord Widget:

        Keep dark theme for consistency.

        Add a soft border-radius or subtle drop shadow.

5. Server Info (.server-info)

    Dynamic Display:

        Style it like a mini status panel.

        Icons for "server name" and "online" count.

        Add a loading spinner while data loads.

        Background box: Semi-transparent card or blurglass.

6. Footer

    Background: Same as body or darker variant.

    Text:

        Small but readable.

        Links: Underlined on hover, muted color.

    Alignment: Centered text with minimal clutter.

7. Responsiveness

    Mobile-first design:

        Stack sections vertically.

        Adjust font sizes and button widths.

        Collapse footer into one line or accordion.

8. Extras (optional)

    Animations: Fade-in on scroll (e.g. AOS library).

    Discord API Improvements: Consider using a server status badge if embedding fails due to CORS.

    Accessibility: Ensure contrast, alt texts, and focus states.
